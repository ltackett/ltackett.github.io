Do you know what's awesome? Hamburgers. You know what's not awesome? Poorly thought-out checkout UX. Here's the story...

I moved last weekend, and to feed my moving crew I decided to get burgers from Five Guys. They even have a handy-dandy iPhone app, too! Sweet! I can order it from the road while my buddy drives the truck to our new place! This is going to work out effing great!

... and it would have, if it weren't for the ambiguous lack of order status after checking out. Did I pay for it? Hm. Better check recent orders. Where is that again? Oh, buried in a submenu... lovely. Ah, there's the order status! "In-progress. Checkout.". Wat. I thought I already checked out? Well, okay, I guess that explains the other ambiguous screen, it must not have gone through. I'll just try again.

... hm, same screen. I think I dun fucked up now. Check bank account. Yep. I just ordered twice on a $45 order. Okayokay, I'll call 'em to let them know the other order was a mistake.

Call. Busy signal.

Call. Busy signal.

Call. Busy signal.

Call. Busy signal.

Check order status. BOTH ARE COMPLETED?? Well, balls. I guess I'm living off of hamburgers for the next couple days.

At least they are delicious hamburgers.
