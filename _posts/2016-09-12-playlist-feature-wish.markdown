Here's a thing I wish was actually a thing: Shuffling between groups of songs.

I mean, putting your favorite playlist on shuffle is great, but there are some songs you want to *always* play next to each other... like songs that blend into each other, etc. Or maybe you have a playlist that changes genres every four or five songs, and you want to shuffle between those blocks.

I'm making a Spotify playlist for when I fly in Elite: Dangerous, and it's very eclectic. It's also very long. I don't want to restart it at the beginning every time I fly. I just wanna hit play, and when I hit "next", it plays the next block of songs in the playlist at random.

God dammit, I think I may need to program something.
